10 pairs of socks, each with a distinct color, are in a drawer. You draw out 2 socks at random. Find the probability that you obtain a matching pair.

**Notes**<br>
Using the tree diagram approach:
```
________         _______
  Red1     *       Red2       *     No.of colors
  2/20     *       1/19       *     10  
  2/20     *       1/19       *     10

```
Explanation: Probability for red pair = (2/20) Ã— (1/19). We multiply this probability by 10 because we have 10 different colors, and this same probability applies to each color (blue pair, green pair, etc.).
