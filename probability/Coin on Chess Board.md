**Easy** <br> 
A chess board consists of 2 inch by 2 inch squares. We toss a coin (diameter of 1 inch) that lands somewhere on the board randomly. 
What is the probability that the coin is completely within one of the 2 inch by 2 inch squares (not on more than 1 square)? 
<br><br>

**Notes**<br>
A chess board as 64 squares arranged in eight vertical rows called files and eight horizontal rows called ranks. These squares alternate between two colors: one light and the other dark. Each square is 2 inches×2 inches. The coin has a diameter of 1 inch, meaning the coin's radius is 0.5 inch. For the coin to be entirely within one square, the center of the coin must stay at least 0.5 inch away from the edges of the square. This restriction creates an inner region within each square where the coin’s center can land. 
The total area of a square is 2×2=4 square inches.
The area of the inner region is 1×1=1 square inch.

Probability = Total area of the square / Area of inner region​ = 1/4​.

Here is the fig. illustrating the 2-inch by 2-inch square with the inner 1-inch by 1-inch region where the coin's center can land.
